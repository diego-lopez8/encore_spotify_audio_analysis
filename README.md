# encore_spotify_audio_analysis

This repository contains the code for an article I wrote here: https://diego-lopez.medium.com/genevas-encore-using-machine-learning-to-classify-emotions-based-on-music-features-4ceae9844c57

Specifically, the data can be generated after registering with Spotify at their website: https://developer.spotify.com

The data directory is a placeholder for where data should be downloaded to, processed and filtered.

The models directory is a placeholder for storing persistent models.

The notebooks directory contains code used to load the models, as well as visualizations and metrics. 

The SRC directory contains code to generate the models, as well as generate data given a API key from Spotify. 

NOTE: The models must be generated from the scripts in SRC before loaded with notebooks. 

All metric visualizations were output to the visualizations directory.
